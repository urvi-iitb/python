Able was I ere I saw Elba. Madam, in Eden, I'm Adam. A man, a plan, a canal, Panama! Racecar radar level kayak civic deed noon civic deed kayak level radar racecar. Was it a car or a cat I saw? Step on no pets. Eva, can I see bees in a cave? No lemon, no melon. Mr. Owl ate my metal worm. A Santa at NASA. Madam in Eden, I'm Adam. Never odd or even. Are we not pure? "No sir!" Panama's moody Noriega brags. It is garbage! Irony dooms a man; a prisoner up to new era. No "x" in Nixon.
